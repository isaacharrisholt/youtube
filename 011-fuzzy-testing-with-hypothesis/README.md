# Randomized Testing In Python With Hypothesis

Property-based testing, or fuzzy testing, is a testing method that allows you
to test your code with massively varying data, all without having to write any
test cases. In this video, we explore how to implement property-based testing
in Python with the Hypothesis library!

## Running the Code

To run the code, first install the requirements:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the tests:

```shell
pytest
```
