If we have lots of different ways of doing the same thing, how do we best
represent that in Python? If we want to take a payment, but want to change our
payment processor on the fly, how do we write clean, idiomatic Python code
without lots of conditional statements everywhere?

Introducing the strategy pattern!

The strategy pattern is a design pattern that allows us to change the behavior
of a class at runtime. It's a great way to write code that is flexible,
extensible, and easy to maintain.

## Running the Code

All three stages of the code from the video are present in this directory:

- `1-conditionals` - the original state of the code
- `2-strategy-pattern` - the code after applying the strategy pattern
- `3-single-method-interfaces` - the code after applying the single method
  interface form of the strategy pattern

To run the code, just `cd` into the directory of the stage you want to run,
and run `python main.py`.
