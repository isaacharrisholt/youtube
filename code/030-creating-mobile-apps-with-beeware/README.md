I've always wanted to be able to create mobile phone apps with Python - ever since I
first learned the language, in fact! And now my dreams have been realised thanks to
BeeWare. This video dives into the fundamentals of creating cross-platform apps with
Python and BeeWare.

## Running the code

Create a virtual environment and install briefcase with Pip:

```

From the `todo_app` directory, run `briefcase dev`.
