# Easily Copy MILLIONS of Files With shutil!

Python makes working with individual files easy thanks to pathlib, but did you
know you can mass copy files with the shutil package?

In this video, we'll dive deep into Python's shutil package, which can be found
in the standard library, covering moving, copying, deleting and even archiving!


## Running the Code

To run the code, simply install the requirements (`pytest`) and run the tests:

```bash
cd 009-shutil-deep-dive
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

If you'd like to run the archive example, just point the script at the
directory you'd like to archive:

```bash
cd 009-shutil-deep-dive
python archive.py ./my-test-dir
```
