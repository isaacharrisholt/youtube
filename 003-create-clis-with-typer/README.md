# Creating Rock Solid CLI Apps With Typer

Creating CLI apps is a great way to get started with Python, but creating truly
great ones can be difficult if you're just using the standard library. In this
video, we'll look at how to use [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to create
rock-solid CLI apps.

For more information, watch the [video](https://youtu.be/8-i3U_3Gxko).

## Running the Code

First, you'll need to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

Once you've installed the dependencies, start a Poetry shell before attempting
to run the CLI tool:

```bash
poetry shell
car --help
```
